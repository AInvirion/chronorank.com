      We’ve seen <a href='http://ift.tt/1BANQx6'>some cool</a> <a href='http://ift.tt/1qUKs0z'>portable</a> <a href='http://ift.tt/15353pV'>Raspberry Pi</a> <a href='http://lifehacker.com/6'>projects</a>, but they’re all pretty complex. Instructables user PiJuice takes a much simpler approach, using just five standard parts to take their Pi on the go.

        Beyond some cables, the build includes a TFT screen, a small handmade case, a keyboard, and a mouse as well as the Raspberry Pi itself. You can purchase the case if you’re interested, but it seems easy enough to build on your own if you have access to a laser cutter (your <a href='http://ift.tt/MH4cPY'>local hackerspace has one</a>, certainly). The end result is a pretty cheap little portable system that’s easy to put together. Head over to Instructables for the full guide.
