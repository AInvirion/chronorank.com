      DIY weather stations are a cool way to monitor the weather in your area for a super accurate look at what’s happening directly around you. Instructables user kkingsbury shows off how you can build your own powered by a Raspberry Pi.

        Kkinsbury’s build uses all types of sensors, gauges, and hardware to measure the weather in all sorts of ways including temperature, rain, wind direction, humidity, pressure, and more. It then displays all that data on a self-hosted web site you can check in on any time you want. As you’d expect, it’s a pretty complex build, but pretty cool nonetheless. Head over to Instructables for the full guide.
