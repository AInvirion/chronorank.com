          Over the course of 3086 queries made by digital marketing consulting firm Stone Temple, Android&#8217;s voice-activated search through <a href="http://ift.tt/1oUJ358">Google Now</a> returned 1795 results enhanced with custom content, while <a href="http://ift.tt/JnJyNW">Siri</a> on the iPhone served up 908 knowledge panels, and Windows Phone&#8217;s <a href="http://ift.tt/1g4zzla">Cortana</a> gave 630. Knowledge panels are custom-built to answer specific types of questions, and do more than just shoot back web results.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Of those knowledge panels, Google Now search scored 88% accuracy for properly addressing questions, Siri came back right 53% of the time, and Cortana got 40%.
