Google Play’s a pretty simple way to get access to all your music. If you’re looking to build a little standalone machine for playing that music, GitHub user fredley created a simple little front end that’s easy to use.

Once you get everything installed on the Pi, you basically have a lightweight little music player that has access to your Google Play library. If you hook it up to something like a touch screen, you’ll have a nice little system that can sit by your stereo for whenever you want to listen to music.
