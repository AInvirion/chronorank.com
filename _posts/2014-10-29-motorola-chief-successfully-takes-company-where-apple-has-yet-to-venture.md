          At the Code Conference, <a href="http://ift.tt/1BgJq1v">Motorola</a> President Rick Osterloh says that his company&#8217;s turnaround effort is similar to what Apple had undergone many years ago. But despite inviting comparisons, the similarities may stop there as Motorola is forging its own path. Osterloh says that Apple&#8217;s control of the premium handset market opens up new opportunities for Motorola Mobility, which is in the middle of being transferred from parent company Google to PC-maker <a href="http://ift.tt/1uCf070">Lenovo</a>.
