      The Raspberry Pi is a DIYers dream, but if you don&#8217;t feel like fiddling with the command line and setting up a project from scratch, here are seven projects you can get up and running with just a few clicks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <p>
        Each of these projects still requires a little post-boot setup to configure everything, but they all have all the software you need to get your project off the ground quickly. At most, all you&#8217;ll need to do is enter in your network password.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>
          How to Install These Projects
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          <p>
            To install these projects, you&#8217;ll just need to clone the images onto an SD card and put that into your Raspberry Pi. The <a href='http://ift.tt/10hpxlE'>process is the same for all of these</a>:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <p>
              <strong>Windows</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Download the IMG file from the project you want to make.
                </li>
                <p>
                  <li>
                    <a href='http://ift.tt/yhjn8C' target='_blank'>Download Win32DiskImager</a> and unzip the application (.exe file) inside.
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      Insert your SD card into your Windows PC using a card reader.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      <li>
                        Open Win32DiskImager.exe, the application you just downloaded, by double-clicking on it. If you&#8217;re running Windows 7 or 8, right click on it and choose &#8220;Run as Administrator&#8221; instead.
                      </li>
                      <p>
                        <li>
                          If your SD card isn&#8217;t automatically detected by the application, click on the drop-down menu at the top right (labeled &#8220;Device&#8221;) and choose it from the list.
                        </li>
                        <p>
                          <li>
                            In the image file section of the application, click the little folder icon and choose the IMG file you just downloaded.
                          </li>
                          <p>
                            <li>
                              Click the Write button and wait for Win32DiskImager to do its thing. When it finishes, you can safely eject your SD card and insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
                            </li>
                            <p>

                                          <p>
                                            <li>
                                              Insert your SD card into your Mac using a card reader.
                                            </li>

                                                Open RPi-sd card builder. You&#8217;ll immediately be asked to choose an image. Choose the IMG file you downloaded earlier.
                                              </li>
                                              <p>
                                                <li>
                                                  You&#8217;ll be asked if your SD card is connected. Since we inserted it earlier, it is, so go ahead and click Continue. You&#8217;ll be presented with SD card options. If you only have one inserted, you won&#8217;t see anything else in the list and it&#8217;ll be checked. If not, just check only the card you want to use and click OK.
                                                </li>

                                                      You&#8217;ll be asked if the SD card was ejected. This is supposed to happen, as the application needs to unmount it so it can perform a direct copy. Double-check that your SD card is no longer available in the Finder. <em>DO NOT</em> remove it from your USB port. When you&#8217;re sure, click Continue.
                                                    </li>

Some people have reported issues using it, so if you run into problems just open up the Terminal app (Your Hard Drive → Applications → Utilities → Terminal) and follow the instructions for Linux.

That&#8217;s why Raspberry Pi forum member rapsberrye <a href='http://ift.tt/18RMEhA' target='_blank'>created a preconfigured image</a> so you don&#8217;t have to do any work.

Your Raspberry Pi will show up as an AirPlay-compatible player right away, and you&#8217;ll even have Watchdog installed to reboot the AirPlay software in case anything goes wrong.

You&#8217;re stuck digging through a bunch of different settings and tweaking different options to get Minecraft to actually run smoothly. <a href='http://ift.tt/18RMBSF' target='_blank'>MinecraftPi</a> fixes that.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        
                                                                        <p>
                                                                          <p>
                                                                            All you need to do is install MinecraftPi onto an SD card and boot it up on your Raspberry Pi. You&#8217;ll need to <a href='http://ift.tt/18RMBSH' target='_blank'>make yourself an admin</a>, but other than that, you can start playing Minecraft on your local network right away. The image is even set to overclock your Pi from the start, so you won&#8217;t even have to mess around with those settings.
                                                                          </p>

If you want to take that online for anyone to access, you&#8217;ll need to follow the guide on PressPi&#8217;s page to open up your router to outside traffic, but otherwise it&#8217;s probably the simplest way to instantly turn your Pi into a web server.
