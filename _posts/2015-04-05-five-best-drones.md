      Whether you’re just getting into the world of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) because you want to take awesome video of your community, do some neighborhood mapping, or just fly something cool looking through the skies, you have tons of great options. This week we’re looking at some of the best, based on your nominations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <p>
        Last week <a href='http://ift.tt/1IreQDU'>we asked you which drones you thought were the best</a>—and by “drone,” we’re using the popular term for any remote controlled flier, from simple plastic R/C helicopters to more advanced quadcopters and hexcopters that are powerful enough to fly for miles with HD cameras strapped to their bodies. You offered up tons of nominations, most serious and some silly, but there are still plenty of great choices. Here are your top five, in no particular order:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>
          <a href='http://ift.tt/1nIHVDI' target='_blank'>Lumenier QAV250</a>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          <p>
            <span><a href="http://ift.tt/1GyKVLf">http://ift.tt/1GyKVLf</a> </span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <p>
              The Lumenier QAV250 may not be a beginner’s drone, but if you’re a hobbyist, a DIY-er, love FPV (first-person view) flying, or just like to get hands on, you’ll love this. This the the kind of UAV that encourages you to make your own modifications to the equipment you buy to tweak it for exactly what you need it to do. The QAV250 is a unibody quadcopter frame that you can buy either on its own, or as part of a kit with everything else you’ll need to get it flying. Depending on the type of flying you want to do, you can buy different components and parts to get your custom model to handle the way you want it to—whether you’re interested in acrobatic, trick flying, pure speed, long range, or beautiful video. The frame can fully support an HD camera too—in fact, the QAV250 has multiple camera mounts, so you can choose. It’s also a light airframe, at less than a half-pound before you start loading it up with gear, and only about a pound or so after that. It has its own landing gear, LED strips to help keep your oriented, and more. The base kit will set you back <a href='http://ift.tt/1HCMK8H' target='_blank'>$130 from Amazon</a> or <a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKTmR' target='_blank'>$150 for a carbon fiber version</a>. An “almost ready to fly” version will <a href='http://ift.tt/1yqTxRZ' target='_blank'>cost you $310 direct</a> (it’s more expensive on Amazon) and a fully flight capable model (you just need to supply a receiver) <a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKTD7' target='_blank'>ill set you back $520 direct</a> (also more expensive on Amazon, so buy direct.)
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <p>
                Those of you who nominated the QAV250 supported it because it’s the perfect frame for DIY enthusiasts, but people who don’t necessarily want to start from scratch (although you can if you want to.) You mentioned that you’ll want to spend some time tweaking your build to fly the way you want it to, but once you do, you have a UAV that’s a blast to fly, and if you’re not sure what to do, the community behind it is large enough that you can learn from other people’s example. This model also makes it easy to do things like swap out for bigger rotors or a different power system. You also praised the QAV250 for being exceptionally durable, and up to the task of flying even after a few punishing landings. Then, once you’ve learned your way around, some subtle tweaks in the included software can give you a completely new flying experience.

                <h3>
                  <a href='http://ift.tt/1qaTUqG' target='_blank'>DJI Phantom 2 Vision+</a>

                      The <a href='http://ift.tt/1gXvXDn' target='_blank'>DJI Phantom 2 Vision</a> and Vision+ are also probably not the most beginner-friendly drones, but they are the ones you’ll probably see in photos and videos when people start talking about the category. The Vision+ earned <a href='http://ift.tt/1teIczg' target='_blank'>The Wirecutter’s “Best Drone” pick</a>, mostly because of its range and battery power, stability and learning curve, mobile app support (so you can mount your phone right on the receiver and see what the Phantom sees, FPV style) for flying and for customization, and for durability. All of those fancy HD videos you see on blogs of city skylines and such? Probably shot with one of these. They’re not cheap though. The Vision+, the most recent model, will <a href='http://ift.tt/1HCMMNX' target='_blank'>set you back $1169 at Amazon</a> (<a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKVLr' target='_blank'>or direct</a>) for a bundle with an extra battery, which you’ll probably want, just to extend your flying time. The older Vision <a href='http://ift.tt/1HCMK8S' target='_blank'>starts at $769 at Amazon</a>, and can be purchased with extras like a second battery and spare rotors, along with a carrying case for the whole unit. Both models give you up to a half-hour of flying time on your first battery, great range and speed, built-in camera stabilization, the ability to plot a “flight path” using your smartphone and receiver, fine control over the camera while you fly, and the ability to grab photos and videos from your Phantom as soon as it lands, via Wi-Fi.

                      <p>
                        Those of you who nominated the Phantom 2 Vision+ praised it for being an amazing quadcopter, praising its battery life but also praising its ability to take incredible video and photos. Our own Shep McAllister owns one, and noted that it’s pretty difficult to <em>not</em> take great video with the thing, and <a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKVLt' target='_blank'>shared one of his own</a>, which looks pretty good to us. Shep wasn’t the only one to share his video either, Jordan <a href='http://ift.tt/1HCMMO3' target='_blank'>posted this one</a>, which also looks amazing. Beyond all of that, many of you pointed out that even though you do have to really learn how to handle it, the money you drop on this model will get you up and flying, right out of the box, with little to no additional customization required.

                              BLADE’s Nano QX RTF is an simple, affordable quadcopter that many people point out is a great beginner’s drone if you’re interested in getting into the hobby with a durable, tough-to-break by easy-to-master model. The Wirecutter <a href='http://ift.tt/1teIczg' target='_blank'>suggested it for beginners in their article on the best drones</a>, and Tom’s Guide says <a href='http://ift.tt/1Fl08hw' target='_blank'>it’s the best for the money</a>. Part of the reason it’s so beginner-friendly is that BLADE has integrated automatic stability controls (in the form of their “Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope” or “SAFE” technology) along with a light, tough airframe and prop guards to help keep it sturdy and in good flying condition regardless of what you do with it. The Nano QX RTF is also a tiny drone—about palm-sized, so you can fly it indoors or outside, whichever you prefer. It’ll set you back $90 direct or <a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKW1T' target='_blank'>from Amazon</a>.

                                Those of you who nominated it also pointed out that it’s a great trainer to work with. It doesn’t have swappable batteries, or a fancy rig for a camera or anything, but after you spend some time with it, you’ll be ready to control and fly larger, heavier, and more complicated models without crashing them into things on your first flight. Others of you pointed out that it’s easily upgradable with an FPV kit and LEDs and other mods, although you have to be careful not to weigh its frame down too much.

                                      Parrot’s maker of some of the most recognizable drones (like the <a href='http://ift.tt/wg5oSD' target='_blank'>Parrot AR Drone</a>, for example) recently released the Parrot Bebop, a medium-sized drone with an integrated camera that’s easy to fly and versatile, but also offers FPV piloting and support for Parrot’s own SkyController unit or using your smartphone or tablet to pilot the Bebop while you fly. It’s small enough to fly indoors, and the 14MP integrated fisheye HD camera on the front captures great detail of anything you pass over (or through.) It’s a lightweight drone, built for stability, not necessarily agility, and the discrete controls allow you to pan your camera view while keeping the drone itself level and steady. The drone even generates its own Wi-Fi hotspot, which is a fairly impressive feat. If you want one, it’ll set you back <a href='http://ift.tt/1HCMKpc' target='_blank'>$500 at Amazon for the unit, ready to fly</a>, but if you want the SkyController custom receiver, you’ll need to grab the <a href='http://ift.tt/1GyKW21' target='_blank'>$900 bundle</a> instead. Despite its price, the Bebop is designed to be a nice middle ground between more expensive, high-end models that take skill to pilot, and the lower-end plastic models for beginners. If you have the cash to blow, this could be a solid beginner’s model, albeit pricey for an entry point.
                                    </p>

                                        Those of you who nominated it praised the Bebop’s attention to durability and safety (in an emergency, the drone can land itself and in any collision, it stops its rotors automatically) along with its ease of use and stability. It’s relatively new, and you also praised it for getting up to 2km of range when you use the SkyController unit along with it. At the same time, its size and all that onboard equipment mean you take a hit in battery life, with some people reporting as little as ten minutes on a charge, depending on what you’re doing.

                                              If ready-to-fly options don’t appeal to you, or you’re concerned with things like battery life or electronics, or the kind of camera you’d mount on your UAV, or if you look at some of these expensive options and wonder if you can do it yourself, you really can—the Lumenier above is a good example of an airframe you can buy as a DIY kit or as a RTF model, but it’s just at the surface of the DIY drone building world. With some elbow grease, the right tools, and the help of a massive community of enthusiasts, you can build your own to do whatever you want—whether you’re interested in racing and agility, long distance and range, carrying capacity, or beautiful HD video. Once you start researching DIY drones and models you can assemble yourself, you quickly dive into a world of custom motors and rotors, electrical systems, lightweight batteries and durable airframes, and cameras and gimbals to help you capture video while you fly.
