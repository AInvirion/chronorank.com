The Seattle GNU/Linux Conference (SeaGL) has just announced Karen  
Sandler, executive director of Software Freedom Conservancy, as a  
keynote speaker and opened its Call for Participation. SeaGL is  
a free software conference in downtown Seattle, taking place on  
October 24 and 25, 2014. The Seattle Central Community College is  
hosting the event, so expect plenty of opportunities for students,  
as well as professionals and free software enthusiasts.

The SeaGL Call for Participation is now open! Get involved by  
submitting a proposal and sharing this call widely. Giving a talk at a  
free software event is great way to meet new people and learn new  
things. SeaGL is especially <a href="http://seagl.org/news/2014/06/20/CFP-Open.html" target="_blank">interested in hearing from new<br />speakers</a>

You can find out more about SeaGL, October 24-25 2014, by  
emailing <a href="mailto:participate@seagl.org" target="_blank">participate@seagl.org</a> or visiting them on IRC  
on <a href="https://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml" target="_blank">Freenode</a> in
