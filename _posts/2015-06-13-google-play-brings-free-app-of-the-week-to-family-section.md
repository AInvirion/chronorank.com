        In its <a href="http://ift.tt/1dufNli">recently launched Family section</a>, Google Play is now hosting a &#8216;Free App of the Week&#8217; for the first time ever. The app this week, Daniel Tiger Grr-ific Feelings by PBS KIDS, is the first time we are seeing a paid app go free, that will likely return to a paid app.
