We’ve seen that it’s <a target="_blank" href="http://ift.tt/1KUE1ya">pretty easy to set up a Raspberry Pi as a Tor proxy</a> before, but it takes a bit of know-how and time to get one up and running. If you’re looking for an easy way out, GitHub user CMoncur wrote some scripts to automate the process.

With CMoncur’s guide, you can make the exact same Tor Proxy created by Adafruit linked above in way less steps. The scripts basically automate the setup process and bulk of the downloads. This makes it a much easier project for beginners or for people who just don’t have a ton of time on their hands. You’ll still need to configure everything for your personal network, but it’s much easier than building it from scratch. From then on out, you’ll have your own [Tor proxy](http://ift.tt/1k5MA4a) that’ll help keep your browsing a bit more secure.
