        Our weekly app picks
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        It&#8217;s <a href="http://ift.tt/1HG2Ouv">Appday Sunday</a> and that means we&#8217;re back with more of our favorites to share. Every week we bring a handful of great apps to the table and share them with everyone. Sometimes they are new apps, sometimes old standards, but every time they are apps we love to use.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Give these a look and then take a minute to tell us all about the apps you are using and love so we can give them a try. We all find some of our favorites right in the comments on these posts!
