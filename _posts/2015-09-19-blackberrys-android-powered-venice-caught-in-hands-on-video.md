        Now that the <a href="http://ift.tt/1KCRlYz">BlackBerry Venice</a> has seemingly made its way out of Waterloo in a larger way, the leaks have been coming rather quickly. A few days ago, the device was snapped up in <a href="http://ift.tt/1FN9wZV">several new images</a> but now, the device has been caught in a hands-on video, oddly enough from <a href="https://www.baka.ca/">a Bell Mobility retailer</a>. Although the video doesn&#8217;t go very deep into the device, we get a pretty good look at some of the basics such as BlackBerry Device Search, how notifications will work as well as a glimpse of the device set up.
