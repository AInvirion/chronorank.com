Chrome: [ADB is a handy tool](http://ift.tt/1oWzwfC) for managing your rooted Android device. While it’s never been easier to [install ADB on any OS](http://ift.tt/1uqLv6E), ADB for Chrome makes it even easier by installing directly to your browser.

ADB for Chrome was created by the developer of popular root apps such as Helium Backup and ROM Manager. The tool allows you to connect to your Android device via USB and send ADB commands. It can also record screenshots or video remotely, in the event that the built-in tools in Android aren’t enough for your needs.
