Part of the appeal of the Raspberry Pi is how easy it is to get kids into coding. Case in point, Geek Gurl Diaries shows you how to build an interactive pixel pet that senses when you shake it using a Raspberry Pi and a few lines of Python.

The project uses a sensor to tell when you shake it and a tiny LED screen to show the animal. Then, you’ll just need to write the program that tells the screen how to behave. It’s a great learning project for both the Pi and Python, plus you’ll end up with an adorable little toy in the end.
