## About the Author

Hi there! My name is Jane Doe, and I'm a freelance writer based in New York City. I love writing about technology, travel, and food, and my work has appeared in a variety of publications.

When I'm not writing, I enjoy hiking, reading, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen. You can find me on Twitter [@janedoe](https://twitter.com/janedoe) or on my website [janedoe.com](https://janedoe.com).
