  <h2>Welcome to my blog</h2>
  <p>
    I share thoughts on technology, open source, license compliance, Linux, and more. 
    I write in Spanish and Englishâ€”though Spanish is my native language, please excuse any rough edges in my English posts.
  </p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
	I am an experienced Open Source Engineer with a proven track record of leadership and technical expertise. As a <strong>Principal Open Source Engineer at Amazon</strong>, I lead the license compliance team and define technical strategies for designing compliance methodologies and tools.
  </p>
  <p>
	In previous roles, I served as a technical advisor to legal teams and provided technical leadership for compliance audits. Additionally, I have experience managing development teams, overseeing architectural design, and leading cross-company projects.
  </p>
  <p>
	Throughout my career, I have been committed to providing technical guidance and mentorship to other engineers, ensuring best practices for software development and Open Source.
