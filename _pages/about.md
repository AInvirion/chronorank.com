<p>Welcome to my blog, where I write about technology, Open Source, License Compliance, Linux, etc. I write posts in Spanish and English, but since I'm a native Spanish speaker, please excuse the raw English.</p>

<p>
I am an experienced Open Source Engineer with a proven leadership and technical expertise track record. As Principal Open Source Engineer at Amazon Web Services, I lead the license compliance team and define technical strategies for designing compliance methodologies and tools. In previous roles, I served as a technical advisor for legal teams and provided technical leadership for compliance audits. I also have experience managing development teams, overseeing architecture design, and leading cross-company projects.
</p>
<p>
Throughout my career, I have been committed to providing technical guidance and mentorship to other engineers, ensuring best practices for software development and Open Source.
